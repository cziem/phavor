[![Hello 👋🏻](https://i.ibb.co/cD2djdy/George-Favour-Github-Banner.png)][1]

Hey 👋🏻,

Growing up in a consumer world, I have seen first-hand the limiting effect of this mindset. My mission is to reshape this mindset and help our growing communities become producers of quality software and technology solutions.

I am a Software Engineer currently in Abia, Nigeria. I love **JavaScript**, **ReactJS** and **Typescript**.

You can see what I am currently up to on [kodeinstincts][1].
